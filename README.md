# Automatic-Water-Dispenser-Using-Arduino-Nano-and-Flow-Sensor
This project is an automatic water dispenser using Arduino and a flow sensor. Users select a fixed water quantity through buttons and an LCD. The flow sensor counts pulses to measure water accurately. The motor stops automatically after dispensing the selected amount, reducing water wastage.
